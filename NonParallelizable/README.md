# mazes-for-programmers
Coding along with "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck

Updates:  
**Jan 2020**: Moved code to .NET Core and added a web interface. Running the "MazeWeb" project provides a parameterized way to generate mazes. Graphical mazes are shown in the browser. An article about this project is coming soon.

**Cross-Platform Note**:  
This project uses GDI+. If you're running on macOS or Linux and you get a GDI+ error, just follow the advice in this article: [SOLVED: System.Drawing .NETCore on Mac, GDIPlus Exception](https://medium.com/@hudsonmendes/solved-system-drawing-netcore-on-mac-gdiplus-exception-c455ab3655a2)
